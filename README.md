> Level: Programmer in training

I'm a full stack developer looking for a role that lets me use my problem-solving skills proactively.

To better understand the world we live and the solutions we need, I did a masters Sustainable Development at Stellenbosch University. I then moved to London to focus all my time and energy on becoming a better software developer. 

I am an independant thinker fascinated in technology and sustainability megatrends. I am proactive and solutions-oriented, and love pushing myself to learn fast. I love working hard on things I care about, and work well within diverse groups and independently while having a natural curiosity for how things work.
