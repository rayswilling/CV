> Level: Programmer in training

I am an independant thinker, fascinated with technology and sustainability megatrends. I am proactive and solutions-oriented, looking to harness my passion for programming. I love working hard on things I care about, and work well within diverse groups and independently while having a natural curiosity for how things work.

I recently completed a Masters at Stellenbosch University. The day after I completed my studies, I applied for a UK ancestral visa and decided to focus all my time and energy in becoming a better software developer.

<details><summary>When I'm not programming</summary>
<p>

I frequently attend lectures and conferences to keep up to date with the fast paced changes in technology.

I also have a fascination with all things fermentation. A plethora of bubbling jars
in my kitchen eventually turn into breads, pickles or wines. When I’m not
playing food scientist or in front of the computer, I’m out running,
skateboarding, climbing or taking something apart to see how it works.
